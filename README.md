AI Product Manager | Data-Driven Builder | Applied AI & Data Science  

Hi 👋  
I’m a Product Manager with a strong technical background and a long-standing interest in data, software, and experimentation.

Over the years, I’ve built and contributed to multiple technical projects.  
Today, my focus is on **AI-powered products**, where data science, machine learning, and product thinking come together to drive real business decisions.

This GitHub represents a **new chapter**: a curated portfolio of applied Data Science and AI projects, connected explicitly to product problems and decision-making.

## 🎯 What this GitHub is about

This is **not** a collection of random tutorials or isolated scripts.

Here you’ll find:
- 📊 **Data Science projects** framed as product problems  
- 🤖 **Applied machine learning** for decision support  
- 🧪 **Experiments, models, and trade-offs**, not just outputs  
- 🧠 **Product thinking over data**: assumptions, risks, and limitations  

Some earlier repositories reflect my learning journey and technical foundations.  
New projects reflect my current focus on **AI Product Management**.

## 🚀 Portfolio Roadmap (In Progress)

The following projects are either completed or actively being built:

- **User Conversion Prediction**  
  Using regression models to estimate conversion likelihood and inform product strategy.

- **Customer Segmentation**  
  Clustering users to support lifecycle, pricing, and engagement decisions.

- **User Feedback & Sentiment Analysis**  
  NLP techniques applied to real user reviews to extract product insights.

- **Experimentation & Causal Thinking**  
  Understanding correlation vs causation in real product experiments.

Each project is documented from a **product-first perspective**.

## 🧠 How I approach AI Products

- AI is a **decision support tool**, not a magic solution.
- Metrics and business context come **before** model choice.
- Interpretability and robustness often matter more than raw accuracy.
- Every model introduces assumptions, bias, and product risk.

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Git & GitHub
- Markdown documentation
