Hi 👋  
I’m a Senior Product Manager with an engineering background, specialized in
streaming and subscription-based products.

Earlier in my career, I worked as a **Technical Evangelist at Microsoft and Nokia**
and spent several years as an **Android developer**, building and supporting
mobile products across diverse ecosystems.

Today, while I no longer work as a full-time developer, I stay deeply connected
to technology and development. I focus on **AI-powered product capabilities**,
applying Data Science and Machine Learning to real problems like conversion,
retention, pricing, and lifecycle decision-making.

This GitHub represents a **new chapter**: a curated portfolio of applied Data
Science and AI projects, explicitly connected to real product challenges.

## 🎯 What this GitHub is about

This is not a collection of tutorials or toy notebooks.

This GitHub documents how I apply Data Science and AI to **subscription and
streaming product challenges**, informed by years of real-world experience
operating at scale.

Here you’ll find:
- 🧠 Subscription and monetization problems framed through data
- 📊 Data Science projects grounded in real funnel metrics (conversion, retention, LTV)
- 🤖 Applied machine learning for decision support
- 🧪 Experiments, models, and trade-offs — not just outputs
- 🧠 Product thinking over data: assumptions, risks, and limitations

Some earlier repositories reflect my learning journey and technical foundations.
New projects reflect my current focus on **AI Product Management**.

Projects prioritize clarity, reasoning, and decision impact over production-level code.

## 🚀 Portfolio Roadmap (In Progress)

The following projects reflect how I approach AI and Data Science as
**product capabilities within streaming and subscription ecosystems**:

- **User Conversion Prediction**  
  Estimating subscription conversion likelihood across paywalls and entry points.

- **Customer & Subscriber Segmentation**  
  Clustering users using behavioral and lifecycle signals (RFM-inspired).

- **Churn Risk & Retention Analysis**  
  Applying predictive signals to voluntary and involuntary churn scenarios.

- **User Feedback & Sentiment Analysis**  
  NLP applied to reviews and cancellation reasons to inform product decisions.

- **Experimentation & Causal Thinking**  
  Understanding correlation vs causation in pricing, offers, and paywall experiments.

Each project is documented from a **product-first perspective**.

## 🧠 How I approach AI Products

- AI is a **decision support tool**, not a magic solution.
- Metrics and business context come **before** model choice.
- Interpretability and robustness often matter more than raw accuracy.
- Every model introduces assumptions, bias, and product risk.
- My engineering and development background helps me bridge product, data,
  and engineering teams effectively.

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Git & GitHub
- Markdown documentation
