Hi 👋  
I’m a product leader with an engineering background, focused on applying  
**AI and Data Science as product capabilities** to solve **subscription,
growth, and lifecycle problems** in consumer products.

I don’t build models for the sake of accuracy.  
I build **decision-support systems** that help product teams answer questions like:

- Why are users not converting?
- Which behaviors actually signal intent?
- Where should we intervene — and where should we not?
- What trade-offs are we making when we optimize?

## 🧭 Background

Earlier in my career, I worked as a **Technical Evangelist at Microsoft and Nokia**
and spent several years as an **Android developer**, building and supporting
mobile products across diverse ecosystems.

Today, while I no longer work as a full-time developer, I remain deeply technical.
I operate at the intersection of:

- **Product strategy**
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**
- **Engineering-aware decision making**

My focus is on **applied AI** — turning data, signals, and models into
**clear product decisions**, not just insights.

## ⭐ Featured AI Product Case Study

### 📌 User Conversion — Product-First Data Science Case Study

An end-to-end case study focused on **subscription conversion** in a streaming
product.

This project demonstrates how I:
- Frame ambiguous business problems
- Define meaningful behavioral signals
- Use interpretable models as decision-support tools
- Translate insights into concrete product recommendations

## 🧠 What this GitHub is about

This is **not** a collection of tutorials, toy notebooks, or Kaggle-style projects.

This GitHub is a **case-based AI Product portfolio**, grounded in
**real product constraints**, including:

- Limited experimentation capacity
- Noisy behavioral data
- Trade-offs between accuracy, interpretability, and usability
- The need to make decisions under uncertainty

Across projects, you’ll find:
- 🧠 Product-first framing before modeling
- 📊 Funnels, lifecycle thinking, and LTV-oriented signals
- 🤖 Interpretable models used for understanding, not just prediction
- 🧪 Explicit assumptions, risks, and limitations
- 🧩 Clear separation between insights and recommendations

---

## 🧠 How I think about AI Products

- AI is a **means to better decisions**, not an end
- Product context and metrics come **before** model selection
- Interpretability often matters more than marginal accuracy gains
- Every model embeds assumptions and product risk
- Strong AI products require tight alignment between product, data, and engineering

## 🗺️ Portfolio roadmap

Current and upcoming case studies focus on:

- **User Conversion & Monetization**
- **Customer & Subscriber Segmentation**
- **Churn & Retention Modeling**
- **User Feedback & Sentiment Analysis**
- **Experimentation & Causal Thinking**

Each case follows a consistent structure:
**problem → signals → insights → decisions**.
