Hi 👋  
I’m a product leader with an engineering background, focused on **AI-powered,
data-informed decision-making** for **streaming and subscription products**.

Earlier in my career, I worked as a **Technical Evangelist at Microsoft and Nokia**
and spent several years as an **Android developer**, building and supporting
mobile products across diverse ecosystems.

Today, while I no longer work as a full-time developer, I stay deeply connected
to technology and development. I apply **Data Science and Machine Learning**
as **product capabilities** to solve real problems like conversion,
retention, pricing, and lifecycle optimization.

This GitHub represents a **curated portfolio** of applied AI and Data Science
projects grounded in **real product challenges**.

## ⭐ Featured AI Product Case Study

📌 **User Conversion — Product-First Data Science Case Study**  
An end-to-end analysis of subscription conversion in a streaming product:
from problem framing and signal definition
to modeling, insights, and product recommendations.

## 🎯 What this GitHub is about

This is **not** a collection of tutorials or toy notebooks.

This GitHub documents how I apply AI and Data Science to **subscription and
streaming product decisions**, informed by years of experience operating at scale.

You’ll find:
- 🧠 Subscription and monetization problems framed through data
- 📊 Behavioral funnels, lifecycle signals, and LTV-oriented thinking
- 🤖 Interpretable models used as decision-support tools
- 🧪 Explicit trade-offs, assumptions, and limitations
- 🧠 Product reasoning over raw model performance

Some earlier repositories reflect my technical foundations.
Newer projects reflect my current focus on **AI Product Management**.

## 🧠 How I approach AI Products

- AI is a **decision-support system**, not a magic solution
- Product context and metrics come **before** model choice
- Interpretability often matters more than marginal accuracy gains
- Every model introduces assumptions, bias, and product risk
- My engineering background helps bridge product, data, and engineering teams

## 🚀 Portfolio roadmap (in progress)

- **User Conversion & Monetization** — signal-driven conversion analysis  
- **Customer & Subscriber Segmentation** — lifecycle and behavioral clustering  
- **Churn & Retention Modeling** — voluntary and involuntary churn scenarios  
- **User Feedback & Sentiment Analysis** — NLP for product insight  
- **Experimentation & Causal Thinking** — beyond correlation

Projects are documented from a **product-first perspective**.
